<h1>Welcome to Ripple.</h1>
<h3 class="op-low">Ripple is a private osu! server done right.</h3>

<h3 class="op-low">(don't worry, icons still exist on Ripple. It's just Linux that is a bit buggy).</h3>

<h1>We have leaderboards.</h1>

<h1>And we have much, much more to come!</h1>
<h3 class="op-low">(oh, also. We are 100% independent from osu!, and have an independent avatar system).</h3>

<h2>Ripple is the result of two italian developers who, in a hot summer, decided that it was about time to create their own osu! server.</h2>
<h2>Countless hours of effort have been put into developing this.</h2>
<h2>And we are just getting started.</h2>
<h2>As we want to get a lot of people involved in the project, we are hoping to release it as open source fairly soon.</h2>
<h2>So you can help us.</h2>
<h2>And make your own server.</h2>
